# Database_Phase1_Final_Project
ðŸ“¦ E-commerce Database Management System
ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project is the Final Assignment for Week 8 of the Database Design & Programming with SQL module at PLP Academy. It demonstrates the design and implementation of a relational database system using MySQL, along with an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the schema.

The database models a simple E-commerce Store, covering customers, products, orders, and payments. It showcases one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Design a full-featured relational database schema.

Implement the schema in MySQL with proper constraints.

Demonstrate relationships between entities.

Provide a .sql file and ERD diagram as deliverables.

ðŸ—‚ Database Schema
Entities
Customers: Stores customer details.

Products: Stores product catalog.

Orders: Records customer purchases.

OrderItems: Bridge table for many-to-many relationship between Orders and Products.

Payments: Records payments for orders.

Relationships
One-to-Many: Customers â†’ Orders

Many-to-Many: Orders â†” Products (via OrderItems)

One-to-One: Orders â†’ Payments

ðŸ›  SQL Implementation
The schema is implemented in the file: final_project.sql

Key features:

PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and NOT NULL constraints.

Composite primary key in OrderItems.

Referential integrity enforced with foreign keys.

ðŸ§ª Sample Data
Example inserts are included in the .sql file to test the schema:

sql
INSERT INTO Customers (name, email, phone)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com', '08012345678');

INSERT INTO Products (name, price, stock)
VALUES ('Laptop', 250000.00, 10),
       ('Headphones', 15000.00, 50);

INSERT INTO Orders (customer_id, order_date)
VALUES (1, '2025-09-24');

INSERT INTO OrderItems (order_id, product_id, quantity)
VALUES (1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2);

INSERT INTO Payments (order_id, amount, payment_date)
VALUES (1, 280000.00, '2025-09-24');
ðŸ–¼ ERD Diagram
The ERD diagram (ecommerce_erd.png) illustrates the database structure and relationships.

Customers (1) â†’ (âˆž) Orders

Orders (âˆž) â†’ (âˆž) Products (via OrderItems)

Orders (1) â†’ (1) Payments

ðŸ“¤ Deliverables
final_project.sql â†’ Database schema and sample data.

ecommerce_erd.png â†’ ERD diagram.

README.md â†’ Documentation (this file).

ðŸš€ How to Run
Open MySQL Workbench or CLI.

Run the script:

sql
SOURCE final_project.sql;
Verify tables with:

sql
SHOW TABLES;
Query data, e.g.:

sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
